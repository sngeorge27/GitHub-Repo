### App Idea Evaluation

- Categroy: Social Networking/Communication
- Mobile: Could be downloaded on a computer or tablet but would be most efficient and popular as a mobile application
- Story: Increases online communication with another user while keeping messages private. 
         It also increases storage since messages are automatically deleted after it is read (within a certain time (10 - 15 days) and the user types a new message
- Market: Any mobile user can use it on either a daily base. 
          It will allow all types of users from children to adults who have access to the phone. Worlwide it will be accessible to download as well.
- Habit: Cell phone users are constantly sending text messages on a daily base. 
         They are having to delete them constantly to keep their phone free from clutter, this will allow them to save time for other stuff.
- Scope: The app is like Snapchat in that messages are deleted after a certain time, but this app is mainly made for text messaging purposes only and keeping privacy in text messages. 
         Notifications will be given a few days before the messages are deleted in order to warn the users beforehand.
